   - Why does Go not has package versions?
   - Why there is an extensive usage of =nil=?

** Notes
   - There are no class hierarchies
   - There are no classes
   - "complexity is multiplicative"
   - The go standard library has over 100 packages for common tasks.
   - The basic keywords are
     - func
     - var
     - const
     - type
   - The opening brace { of the function must be on the same line as the end of
     the =func= declaration, not on a line by it self.
   - In the expression x + y a, a new line is permitted after but not before the + operator
   - The for loop is the only loop statement in Go. 
   - The *blank identifier*, whose name is =_= may be used whenever syntax
     requires a variable name but program logic does not.
   - Maps (or hashes in perl, or dicts in python)
     #+BEGIN_SRC go
     counts := make(map[string]int)

     input := bufio.NewScanner(os.Stdin)
	   for input.Scan() {
		    counts[input.Text()]++
	   }

     for line, n := range counts {
	    	if n > 1 {
			      fmt.Printf("%d\t%s\n", n, line)
		    }
     }
     #+END_SRC
     - A map holds a set of key/value pairs and provides constant-time
       operations to store, retrieve or test for an item in the set.
     - The key may be of any type whose values can be compared with == 
     - The value may be of any type.
   - The =bufio= package helps to make input and output efficient and
     convenient. One of its most useful features is a type called =Scanner= that
     reads input and breaks it into lines or words; it's often the easiest way
     to process input that comes naturally in lines.
   - =Printf= has over a dozen such conversions, which Go programmers call
     *verbs*. This table is far from a complete specification but illustrates
     many of the features that are available.

     | Conversion | Description                                                    |
     |------------+----------------------------------------------------------------|
     | %d         | decimal integer                                                |
     | %x, %o, %b | integer in hexadecimal, octal, binary                          |
     | %f, %g, %e | floating-point number: 3.141593 3.141592653589793 3.141593e+00 |
     | %t         | boolean: =true= or =false=                                     |
     | %c         | rune (Unicode code point)                                      |
     | %s         | string                                                         |
     | %q         | quoted string "abc" or rune 'c'                                |
     | %v         | any value in a natural format                                  |
     | %T         | type of any value                                              |
     | %%         | literal percent sign (no operand)                              |

   - By convention, formatting functions whose names end in =f=, such as
     =log.Printf= and =fmt.Errorf= use the formatting rules of =fmt.Printf=.
   - Formatting functions whose names end in =ln= follow =Println=, formatting
     their arguments as if by =%v=, followed by a new line.
   - The function =os.Open= returns two values. The first is an open file
     (=*os.File=). The second result is a value of the built-in =error= type. If
     =err= equals the special built-in value =nil=, the file was opened
     successfully.
   - A =map= is a *reference* to the data structure created by =make=. When a
     map is passed to a function, the function receives a copy of the reference,
     so any changes the called functions makes to the underlying data structure
     will be visible through the caller's map reference too. In our example, the
     values inserted into the =counts= map by =countLines= are seen by =main=
     #+BEGIN_SRC go
func main() {
	counts := make(map[string]int)
	files := os.Args[1:]
	if len(files) == 0 {
		countLines(os.Stdin, counts)
	} else {
		for _, arg := range files {
			f, err := os.Open(arg)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "dup2: %v\n", err)
				continue
			}
			countLines(f, counts)
			f.Close()
		}
	}
	for line, n := range counts {
		if n > 1 {
			fmt.Printf("%d\t%s\n", n, line)
		}
	}
}

func countLines(f *os.File, counts map[string]int) {
	input := bufio.NewScanner(f)
	for input.Scan() {
		counts[input.Text()]++
	}
	// NOTE: ignoring potential errors from input.Err()
}
     #+END_SRC
   - =ReadFile= reads the entire content of a named file.
